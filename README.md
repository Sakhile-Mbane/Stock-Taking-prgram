# Stock-Taking-prgram

Let us assume that you work for a Nike warehouse. Your role is that of a store
master, meaning you are responsible for managing the warehouse, and more
importantly, doing stock taking. To optimize your delivery time and for neater
organization, you have decided to use your Python knowledge to get an overview
of what each stock-taking session entailed.

Nike warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list:

● Country

● Code

● Product

● Cost

● Quantity

● Value

Other store managers (in other regions) would like to be able to use your program
to do the following:

● Search products by code.

● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.

● Determine the product with the highest quantity.

● Calculate the value of each item entry, based on the quantity and cost of the
item. The value is calculated by multiplying the cost by the quantity for each
item entered.
